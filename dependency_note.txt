Note that we have not included a `requirements.txt` file in this repo. Our codebase is made up of two preexisting shadow removal methods and one novel method, each with their own conflicting dependencies. Additionally, in the case of the novel method, not all of the dependencies can be installed from `pip` or `conda`. 

To reproduce our results with each method, refer to the various "Usage" sections in the README.
